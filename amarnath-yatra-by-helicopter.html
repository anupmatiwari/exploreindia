        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Amarnath Yatra is one of the most important pilgrimages for many devotees in India. The main attraction is the naturally forming ice Shiva Lingam, which appears every year in the Amarnath cave high in the Himalayas. Traditionally, pilgrims reach the cave by walking along mountain trails from Pahalgam or Baltal. For many people, the trek can be long and difficult.</p>

        <p>In recent years, helicopter services have become a popular way to reach the Amarnath area quickly and with less physical strain. A helicopter Yatra is suitable for elderly travelers, people with limited time, or anyone who prefers comfort and speed. This page explains how the Amarnath Yatra by helicopter works, offers a simple sample itinerary, cost estimates, safety advice and how to book.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why choose a helicopter Yatra?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Less travel time:</strong> A helicopter flight can cut travel time significantly compared to the multi-day trek.</li>
          <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> No long walks with heavy bags; suitable for elderly or those with health issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear schedule:</strong> Operators usually run fixed schedules and provide ground support.</li>
          <li><strong>Scenic views:</strong> Flying over the Himalaya gives great views of rivers, valleys and snowy peaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">Note: Helicopter services are weather-dependent. Flights can be delayed or canceled if the weather is not safe for flying. Always keep buffer days in your plan.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Common Helicopter Routes</h2>
        <p>There are two main base points for Amarnath helicopter services: <strong>Pahalgam</strong> and <strong>Baltal</strong>. Some packages start from Srinagar (airport) and include road transfers to the helipad.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Srinagar → Pahalgam → Amarnath:</strong> Transfer by road to Pahalgam, then a short helicopter hop toward the Amarnath area.</li>
          <li><strong>Srinagar → Baltal → Amarnath:</strong> Baltal is a shorter trek base; helicopters from Baltal can reach near the cave area in less time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Operators arrange short flights that land at approved helipads. From the helipad there may still be a short walk or local transfer to reach the cave area or the darshan point.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sample 3–4 Day Itinerary (Simple)</h2>
