      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Muktinath is a sacred place in the Mustang region of Nepal. It is a holy site for both Hindus and Buddhists. The temple sits at a high altitude and offers stunning mountain views. Traditionally, people visit Muktinath by long road travel or by trekking. Many pilgrims now choose a helicopter Yatra to save time and reduce physical strain.</p>
      <p>A helicopter trip makes the visit faster and more comfortable. In this guide, you will learn what to expect, how to book, and how to stay safe. The language is simple so that anyone can follow the steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why choose a helicopter for Muktinath?</h2>
      <p>There are a few good reasons people pick a helicopter trip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time saving:</strong> A helicopter flight can cut several hours or days of travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> No long jeep rides on rough roads. Less walking and less strain on your body.</li>
        <li><strong>Safer for some people:</strong> Older pilgrims or those with health issues may find the helicopter option easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Better views:</strong> Flying gives you wide views of the valley and mountains.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Keep in mind: helicopter flights depend on weather. Strong wind, fog, or rain can cause delays or cancellations. Always keep one or two buffer days in your plan.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where do helicopters start from?</h2>
      <p>Most helicopter services to Muktinath start from Pokhara or Jomsom in Nepal. Some packages begin in Kathmandu and include a short domestic flight to Pokhara first. The exact start point depends on the operator and the season.</p>
      <p>Common base points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pokhara:</strong> Easy to reach, many tourist services, and a common base for Mustang area flights.</li>
        <li><strong>Jomsom:</strong> A local hub. Some operators move travelers to Jomsom before the helicopter flight.</li>
        <li><strong>Kathmandu:</strong> Some travelers use Kathmandu as the main entry city and then transfer to Pokhara.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sample 4-day itinerary (simple and calm)</h2>
      <p>This sample plan gives time for rest and for possible weather delays. Follow it as a simple example. Operators may have different schedules.</p>

      <h3>Day 1 — Arrive in Pokhara</h3>
      <p>Arrive at Pokhara by flight from Kathmandu or by road. Check in to your hotel. Meet your tour operator and confirm the helicopter plan. Keep your ID and booking papers ready.</p>

      <h3>Day 2 — Helicopter to Muktinath and darshan</h3>
      <p>Early morning transfer to the helipad. Board the helicopter and fly to the Muktinath helipad. After landing, walk a short distance to the temple for darshan. Spend time at the shrine, perform prayers, and then return by helicopter to your base (Jomsom or Pokhara) depending on the package.</p>

      <h3>Day 3 — Buffer day</h3>
      <p>Keep this day free. Use it if the flight on Day 2 was delayed or canceled. If everything went well, use this day for rest or local sightseeing in Pokhara.</p>

      <h3>Day 4 — Travel home</h3>
      <p>Fly back to Kathmandu or your next destination. Keep copies of all tickets and contacts for the operator. This end day gives time for safe travel and a calm return.</p>

      <p class="note">This 4-day plan is gentle and works well for many pilgrims. If you prefer a faster schedule, some operators offer 2–3 day plans but these have less buffer time for weather delays.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Best time to go</h2>
      <p>The best months for a helicopter trip to Muktinath are from late spring to early autumn. Generally, <strong>May to October</strong> are the most suitable months. During these months, helipads and local roads are more likely to be open and the weather is relatively stable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>May–June:</strong> Clear skies and fresh weather. Good flying conditions most days.</li>
        <li><strong>July–August:</strong> Monsoon season brings clouds and some rain. Mustang lies in a rain-shadow region, but expect more clouds and some flight uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>September–October:</strong> Clear skies return. This is a popular time and offers great views.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Winter months are very cold and may limit access due to snow. Always check the local weather forecast and operator advice before booking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How much will it cost? (simple estimates)</h2>
      <p>Costs vary by operator, season and services included. Here are rough numbers to help you plan. These are only estimates; check with the operator for exact prices.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic seat package:</strong> Typical seat packages might start around <strong>₹25,000 to ₹60,000 per person</strong>. This often includes the helicopter seat and basic transfers.</li>
        <li><strong>Package with hotels and transfers:</strong> If the package adds hotels, meals and local transfers, the price can be higher, roughly <strong>₹40,000 to ₹90,000 per person</strong> depending on the hotel class and included services.</li>
        <li><strong>Private charter:</strong> Hiring an entire helicopter is much more expensive and is charged by flight hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Always ask for a clear price list. Confirm what is included: seat cost, transfers, hotel nights, meals, permit fees and any local taxes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to book — simple steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose a licensed operator:</strong> Book only from operators that have permits to fly in the Mustang region. Check reviews and ask for certificates if you need confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm helipad and route:</strong> Ask where the helicopter will land and how far the helipad is from the temple.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide correct ID:</strong> Operators will need your ID details (passport or government ID) for permits. Share these details when you book.</li>
        <li><strong>Read cancellation rules:</strong> Weather may force a change. Know the operator's refund and reschedule rules before you pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Save contacts:</strong> Keep the operator's phone number, helipad numbers and local emergency contacts in your phone and on paper.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Permits and rules</h2>
      <p>Permit rules may change by season and by local authority. Many operators include permit handling in the package. You must carry valid photo ID. For international visitors, a passport is needed. For Indian citizens, government ID like Aadhaar or passport works.</p>
      <p>Always confirm permit needs with your operator and ask them to help prepare the documents. Keep both digital and printed copies of your IDs and booking receipts.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Safety tips and health advice</h2>
      <p>Mountain flights are safe when you follow rules and choose a trusted operator. Here are basic tips to keep your trip safe and comfortable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrive at the helipad on time. Helicopter schedules are tight and delays affect others too.</li>
        <li>Listen carefully to the pilot and crew briefing. Follow their instructions for boarding and disembarking.</li>
        <li>Wear warm layers. High altitude is cold even in summer mornings.</li>
        <li>Carry medicines for common problems like headaches, stomach upsets or mild altitude sickness.</li>
        <li>Limit heavy activity after landing at high altitude. Rest and hydrate. Altitude affects people differently.</li>
        <li>If you have serious heart or lung conditions, consult your doctor before booking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">If the weather is not safe, do not insist on flying. Pilots and operators make decisions for safety. Stay calm and plan for the next available day.</p>
